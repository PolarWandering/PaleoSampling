       "This repository includes a series of tools and code organized in different folders:\n",
       "- `notebooks`: It includes Jupyter Notebooks with examples of different sampling procedures and the code to parallelize the simulations using Dask (`Parallel.ipynb`).\n",
       "- `figures`: It includes all the Jupyter Notebooks to generate the figures in the paper.\n",
       "- `outputs`: It includes the simulated data from all the simulations used in the figures in `csv` format.\n",
       "- `smpsite`: Python package to run simulations and estimate poles and dispersion (see Installation for more information).\n",
       "\n",
       "We also provide with an `environment.yml` and `Makefile` for setup of the computational environment used for this project.\n",

       "\n",
       "All the notebooks inside this notebook can be executed after properly setting the environmnet. The `environment.yml` file can be used to\n",
       "install all the required dependencies. Beside some standard Python dependencies, the `environment.yml` file include the installation of\n",
       "`Pmagpy` using pip and the extra installation of the module `smpsite` (included in this repository). The package `smpsite` includes all the code used to make the simulations and compute the\n",
       "estimated poles.\n",
       "\n",
       "In order to install the environment, you can use conda or mamba (see [Managing Environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more information) with `conda env create -f environment.yml`. Alternativelly, we included a `Makefile` that allow to create the conda environment and install the associated iPython kernel so this environment can be accessible though Jupyter notebooks all at once.
