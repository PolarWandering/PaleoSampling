       "This repository includes a series of tools and code organized in different folders. \n",
       "- `notebooks`: It includes Jupyter Notebooks with examples of different sampling procedures and the code to parallelize the simulations using Dask (`Parallel.ipynb`).\n",
       "- `figures`: It includes all the Jupyter Notebooks to generate the figures in the paper. \n",
       "- `outputs`: It inclides the simulated data from all the simulations used in the figures in `csv` format.\n",
       "- `smpsite`: Python package to run simulations and estimate poles and dispersion (see Installation for more information). \n",

       "All the notebooks inside this notebook can be executed after properly setting the environmnet. The `environment.yml` file can be used to \n",
       "install all the requiered dependencies. Beside some standard Python dependencies, the `environment.yml` file include the installation of \n",
       "`Pmagpy` using pip and the extra installation of the module `smpsite` (included in this repository). The package `smpsite` includes all the code used to make the simulations and compute the \n",

       "In order to install the environment, you can use conda or mamba (see [Managing Environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more information) with `conda env create -f environment.yml`. Alternativelly, we included a `Makefile` that allow to create the conda environment and install the associated iPython kernel so this environment can be accessible though Jupyter notebooks all at once. In order to do this, you just need to open a terminal where the repository is located and enter\n",
